// iterative vs recursive

// a process that calls itself

// call stack - order that functions initiate or are invoked

// two elements of recursive functions, both of which need return statements:
// base case - condition where the recursion ends
// different inputs 

// helper method recursion:
// recursive function within another outer function: 
// ex: empty array defined in outer function, and recursive function populates values of array

// for pure recursion functions, methods slice, spread operator and concat make copies of arrays so you don't mutate original
